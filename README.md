Important: Use a real email address for registration/login because the app sends notification emails to that address.

If you donâ€™t have an account, click Create account to go to the registration page.

![alt text](image-1.png)  registered yourself by filling all the fields, for now all the fields are required and you can registered as employee or admin and password should be atleast 5 character
once you registered successfully you'll get this![alt text](image-2.png) and it will redirect you again to the login page from there you have to login again using the same email and password. once you logged in successfully you'll get this dashboard![alt text](image-3.png) from here you can apply for new leave by clicking on apply leave![alt text](image-4.png) all the fields are mandatory..
after applying for leave your dashboard will look like this![alt text](image-5.png)
from here you'll able to see all your history of leaves![alt text](image-6.png)  

admin will recieve a mail for the applied leave something like this![alt text](image-7.png) from here admin can approve or reject the leave or he can open the dashboard his dashboard will look like this ![alt text](image-8.png) 
from here also he can approve or reject the leave.

the ui is not that much appealing for now because of time constraints because I had some time constraints and did not have the bandwidth but the functionality is working fine
